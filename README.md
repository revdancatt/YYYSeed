## About

This project was created to play with the new params feature on fxhash, making this the _first_ fxparams project to go live. YYYSEED is an artwork with an aesthetic that works across digital, print and pen plotting mediums, leaning towards the minimalistic nature of drawing machines. SVGs can be exported for this purpose.

I've designed the algorithm to work best for this with the default settings, you should be good to go right out of the box. You can explore the design space a little further using the parameters (more details below).

If you're planning on plotting the work at larger sizes (A2, A1), then the "Override suggest lines" is there for you to cram more of them into the extra space.

## Running

The files you need are...

```
index.html
  ╰ index.js
  ╰ noise.js
  ╰ page.js
  ╰ paper.js
```

...spin up a local webserver or just opening index.html should do the trick, see instructions.md for, well, instructions.

## Code usage

I've placed the code here for educational purposes, for anyone who wants to learn from _somewhat_ badly written code. You may not sell/mint/etc. outputs from this code, you may keep, print, display them for personal use. Please see the LICENSE for more information.
